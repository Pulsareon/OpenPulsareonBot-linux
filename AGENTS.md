This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## 🚀 Initialization Sequence (CRITICAL)

**DO NOT SKIP.** Follow this sequence exactly at the start of every session.

1.  **Read [INIT_RULES.md](rules/INIT_RULES.md)**: This defines your startup protocol.
2.  **Execute the Sequence**: Follow the steps in `INIT_RULES.md` to load your identity, memory, and context.

## 📜 Core Rules

See `rules/RULES-INDEX.md` for detailed guidelines.

- **[MEMORY_RULES.md](rules/MEMORY_RULES.md)**: Memory management.
- **[SAFETY_RULES.md](rules/SAFETY_RULES.md)**: Safety and security.
- **[COMMUNICATION_RULES.md](rules/COMMUNICATION_RULES.md)**: How to talk.
- **[TASK_RULES.md](rules/TASK_RULES.md)**: Session splitting (Spawn).
- **[CONTEXT_RULES.md](rules/CONTEXT_RULES.md)**: Token monitoring.
- **[SYSTEM_RULES.md](rules/SYSTEM_RULES.md)**: System maintenance.

## Make It Yours

This is a starting point. Add your own conventions, style, and rules as you figure out what works.
